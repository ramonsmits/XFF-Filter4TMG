# XFF-Filter4TMG

XFF-Filter for Forefront Threat Management Gateway (TMG) 2010 adds the x-forwarded-for header to http header collection. This is often needed in web environments that require the source address for various reasons. For example for security, fingerprinting, routing or geomapping.

>The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) HTTP header field is a de facto standard for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or load balancer. This is an HTTP request header which was introduced by the Squid caching proxy serverâ€™s developers. An effort has been started at IETF for standardizing the Forwarded HTTP header.


## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the binary distribution of the [XFF-Filter4TMG][blog] that Gabriel Citron originally provided in a blog post in Romanian (thanks Google Translate). I asked Gabriel is he could provide the source code and make it opensource. He quickly responded with the code and now I provide it on github. 

His translated post:
>After moving a publishing web application behind a TMG reverse proxy I got into trouble as it turned out that TMG does not support the X-Forwarded-For header in http requests to retrieve the originating client ip address. After some googling I found a plugin from Websense and a criminally expensive version from Winfrasoft. I then decided to implement my own 64 bit webfilter for TMG 2012 based on an example provided with the TMG SDK.


## Behavior

It seems that the filter behaves as described on xff article on wikipedia.

* Create the X-Forwarded-For header and set its value to the value from `REMOTE_ADDR`
* When the header already exists the `REMOTE_ADDR` value is prepended with a comma to the existing value (client1, proxy1, proxy2, etc.)

## Download

You can [download the XFF-Filter4TMG source via github][source], [clone the github repository][git] or [download the XFF-Filter4TMG binary][binary] in an archive


## Installation

Take the following steps:

* Extract the archive
* Move the file `XFF-Filter.dll` to the folder where TMG is installed (eg `C: \Program Files\Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway`)
* Register the DLL with `regsvr32`

The filter should now be visible in the TMG console and can be enabled / disabled.
